      How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
      'Cause you know I'm okay
      Instead, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"
      You know, you know I'm the same
      I know, I know you don't love me, baby
      They're trying to take you away from me
      Only over my dead body
      
      
      I think I killed everybody in the game last year
      Man, fuck it, I was on though
      And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
      Mm-mm, fuck it, I was wrong though
      Shout out all to all my niggas livin' tax free
      Nowadays, it's six figures when they tax me
      Oh well, guess you lose some and win some
      Long as the outcome is income
      You know I want it all and then some
      Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
      Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
      Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
      Yeah, you know me well, nigga
      Yeah, I mean you ain't the only real nigga
      They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
      Slave to the pussy but I'm just playin' the field nigga, yeah
      Are these people really discussin' my career again?
      Askin' if I'll be goin' platinum in a year again
      Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
      Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
      Man, all of your flows bore me, paint dryin'
      And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine
      And I be hearin' the shit you say through the grapevine
      But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
      Yeah, it's been that way from the beginnin'
      I just been playin', I ain't even notice I was winnin' 
      And this is the only sound you should fear
      Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright
      
      
      Oh, I know you don't love me, baby
      They're trying to take you away from me
      Only over my dead body
      
      
      You say I'm old news, well, who the new star?
      'Cause if I'm goin' anywhere, it's probably too far
      Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
      Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
      Red wine over fed time
      But shout out to the niggas that's doin' dead time
      And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
      And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
      Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
      You and whoever the fuck gave you your start, boy
      Oh, you wanna be a motherfuckin' funny guy?
      Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
      Yeah, it's whatever
      You know, feelin' good, livin' better
      I think maybe I was numb to it last year
      But you know I feel it now more than ever
      My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
      Second album, I'm back pavin' the way
      The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
      Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
      And I met your baby moms last night
      We took a picture together, I hope she frames it
      And I was drinkin' at the Palms last night
      And ended up losin' everything that I came with
      Yeah, feel like I've been here before, huh?
      I still got ten years to go, huh?
      And this is the only sound you should fear
      Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright
      
      
      Oh, I know you don't love me, baby
      They're trying to take you away from me
       Only over my dead body
      
      
      Three in the morning, still going down
